---

This work is a development of an open-source module in the Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) for segregation nonspatial and spatial measures. In urban geography and regional planning, segregation, usually consider five dimensions in a given society such as evenness, isolation, clustering, concentration and centralization. Furthermore, it also presents a novel feature that performs inference for segregation and for comparative segregation, relying on simulations under the null hypothesis.
