                <p><font size="4px">Renan is a biologist, fascinated with plant physiology and molecular biology.</font></p>
                <p><font size="4px">Her Ph.D. goal was to integrate this two big areas and focused on study the differentially expressed genes under drought condition and on identifying mechanisms of response to this stress in castor beans. During this period, she earned a fellowship to develop part of the research at the University of California, campus Riverside, and a new passion had rising: the bioinformatics. She was awarded her Ph.D. in Genetics from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (2016).</font></p>
                <p><font size="4px">After a year and a half working in a private company in Brazil, she joined <a href="http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/">Professor Thomas Girke Lab</a> at UCR in 2017. Her current research focuses on the development of computational <a href="http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/systemPipeR/">data analysis</a> methods for genome biology.</font></p>
