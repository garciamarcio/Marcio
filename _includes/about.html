				Currently, I'm working as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the <a href="https://spatial.ucr.edu/">Center for Geospatial Sciences</a> at the University of California, campus Riverside (UCR). My main interests comprises data analysis, data visualization, statistical modelling, open-source technologies (R, Python, RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.) and Big Data.
